/**
 * A Bean representation of a GeoJSON Feature.
 * 
 * From the GeoJSON Specification version 1.0:
 * 
 * A feature object must have a member with the name "geometry". The value
 * of the geometry member is a geometry object as defined above or a JSON
 * null value.
 * 
 * A feature object must have a member with the name "properties". The value
 * of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a JSON null
 * value).
 * 
 * If a feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier should be
 * included as a member of the feature object with the name "id".
